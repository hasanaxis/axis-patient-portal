# Axis Imaging Patient Portal - Claude Code Development Plan

## Project Overview: Axis Imaging Patient Portal

### What We're Building:
A patient portal mobile and web application for Axis Imaging radiology clinic in Mickleham, Victoria, Australia. This app allows patients to view their scan images and reports, receive notifications when results are ready, and book appointments with their GP to discuss findings.

### Core Purpose:
- Notify patients when their radiology reports are ready
- Allow patients to view their scan images and reports from Axis Imaging
- Enable patients to book radiology appointments at Axis Imaging (X-ray, CT, Ultrasound, DEXA)
- Provide a professional digital experience that enhances Axis Imaging's brand

### Key Business Requirements:
- **Invite-only access** - Only patients who received scans at Axis Imaging can register
- **SMS-driven workflow** - Patients receive invitation after scan, notifications when reports ready
- **Appointment booking** - Patients can book radiology scans at Axis Imaging with GP referrals
- **Patient empowerment** - Allow patients to easily view their scan images and reports
- **Simple, focused experience** - Scan viewing and appointment booking for Axis Imaging services
- **Australian compliance** - HIPAA equivalent, Australian phone numbers, local healthcare standards

### User Journey:
1. Patient gets scan at Axis Imaging ‚Üí System automatically sends SMS invitation to register
2. Patient registers using phone verification ‚Üí Gains access to their scan records
3. When report is ready ‚Üí Patient receives automatic SMS notification
4. Patient views images and report ‚Üí Can contact their own GP separately to discuss results
5. When patient needs new scan ‚Üí Books appointment at Axis Imaging through the app

### Technical Architecture:
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with PostgreSQL database and Prisma ORM
- **Web App**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and DICOM viewer (Cornerstone.js)
- **Mobile Apps**: React Native/Expo for iOS and Android
- **Image Acquisition**: Direct DICOM transfer from modalities (X-ray, CT, Ultrasound) to patient portal
- **Notifications**: Twilio SMS with delivery tracking for Australian phone numbers
- **Hosting**: AWS cloud infrastructure with Australian data residency requirements
- **Security**: Complete audit logging, encryption, and healthcare compliance systems

### Success Metrics:
- Patient engagement with viewing their results
- Increased appointment bookings through the app
- Reduced phone calls to clinic asking about report status
- Professional brand representation for Axis Imaging
- Patient satisfaction with easy access to their scan results
